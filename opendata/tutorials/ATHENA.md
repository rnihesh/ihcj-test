This guide walks you through querying Indian High Court judgment metadata stored in Parquet format on Amazon S3 using AWS Athena.

---

## 🏗️ Setup

### Create a Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE court_cases;
```

### Create a Table for Parquet Files with Partitioning

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE court_cases.judgments ( court_code STRING, title STRING, description STRING, judge STRING, pdf_link STRING, cnr STRING, date_of_registration STRING, decision_date DATE, disposal_nature STRING, court_name STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY ( year STRING, court STRING)
STORED AS PARQUET
LOCATION 's3://indian-high-court-judgments/metadata/parquet/'
TBLPROPERTIES ( 'has_encrypted_data'='false',
  'projection.enabled'='true',
  'projection.year.type'='integer',
  'projection.year.range'='1950,2025',
  'projection.court.type'='enum',
  'projection.court.values'='9_13,27_1,19_16,18_6,36_29,28_2,22_18,7_26,24_17,2_5,1_12,20_7,29_3,32_4,23_23,14_25,17_21,21_11,3_22,8_9,11_24,16_20,5_15,33_10,10_8',
  'storage.location.template'='s3://indian-high-court-judgments/metadata/parquet/year=${year}/court=${court}/'
)
```

## 🔍 Query Examples

### Level 1: Basic Selection

```sql
SELECT 
  court_code,
  title,
  judge,
  date_of_registration,
  decision_date,
  court_name,
  year,
  court
FROM 
  court_cases.judgments
WHERE 
  year = '2025'
  AND court = '32_4'
LIMIT 10;
```

### Level 2: Sorted Results

```sql
SELECT 
  title,
  decision_date,
  judge
FROM 
  court_cases.judgments
WHERE 
  year = '2025'
ORDER BY 
  decision_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Level 3: Pattern Matching with `LIKE`

```sql
SELECT 
  title,
  judge,
  court_name
FROM 
  court_cases.judgments
WHERE 
  judge LIKE '%KRISHNA%'
  AND year = '2025'
LIMIT 10;
```

### Level 4: Aggregation with `GROUP BY`

```sql
SELECT 
  judge,
  COUNT(*) AS total_cases
FROM 
  court_cases.judgments
WHERE 
  year = '2025'
GROUP BY 
  judge
ORDER BY 
  total_cases DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Level 5: `HAVING` Clause

```sql
SELECT 
  court_name,
  COUNT(*) AS total_judgments
FROM 
  court_cases.judgments
WHERE 
  year = '2025'
GROUP BY 
  court_name
HAVING 
  COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY 
  total_judgments DESC;
```

### Level 6: Subquery in `WHERE` Clause

```sql
SELECT 
  title,
  judge,
  court_name
FROM 
  court_cases.judgments
WHERE 
  judge IN (
    SELECT 
      judge
    FROM 
      court_cases.judgments
    WHERE 
      court = '32_4'
    GROUP BY 
      judge
    HAVING 
      COUNT(*) > 5
  )
AND year = '2025';
```

### Level 7: Window Function (RANK)

```sql
SELECT 
  title,
  judge,
  court_name,
  decision_date,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY court_name ORDER BY decision_date DESC) AS recent_rank
FROM 
  court_cases.judgments
WHERE 
  year = '2025';
```
